# quickcommerce

QuickCommerce is a vendor library and PHP micro-service exposing OpenCart 2.x/3.x functionality over a RESTful API. Although intended to be used as part of a QuickCommerce flavored OpenCart installation, it only requires a connection to an OpenCart database to run. Uses Doctrine ORM / DBAL & Slim Framework.
